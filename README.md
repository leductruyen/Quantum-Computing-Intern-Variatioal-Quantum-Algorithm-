## Abstract: 
In this study, we delved into several \textbf{optimization methods}, both classical and quantum, and \textbf{analyzed the quantum advantage that each of these methods} offered, and then we proposed a \textbf{new combinatorial optimization scheme, deemed as QNSPSA\_PSR} which combines calculating approximately Fubini-study metric (QNSPSA) and the exact evaluation of gradient by Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). The \textbf{QNSPSA\_PSR method integrates the QNSPSA computational efficiency with the precise gradient computation of the PSR, improving both stability and convergence speed while maintaining low computational consumption}. Our results provide a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQE's optimization subroutine and enhance viable paths toward efficient quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we also conducted a \textbf{detailed study of quantum circuit ansatz structures} in order to find the one that would work best with the Ising model and NISQ, which we \textbf{utilized the symmetry of the investigated model.
