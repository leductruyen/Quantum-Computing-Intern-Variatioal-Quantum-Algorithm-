## Abstract: 
In this study, we delved into several optimization methods, both classical and quantum, and analyzed the quantum advantage that each of these methods offered, and then we proposed a new combinatorial optimization scheme, deemed as QNSPSA\_PSR which combines calculating approximately Fubini-study metric (QNSPSA) and the exact evaluation of gradient by Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). The QNSPSA\_PSR method integrates the QNSPSA computational efficiency with the precise gradient computation of the PSR, improving both stability and convergence speed while maintaining low computational consumption. Our results provide a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQE's optimization subroutine and enhance viable paths toward efficient quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we also conducted a detailed study of quantum circuit ansatz structures in order to find the one that would work best with the Ising model and NISQ, which we utilized the symmetry of the investigated model.
