## Abstract: In this paper, we conducted a detailed study of several different kinds of quantum circuit ansatz structures in order to find the one that would work best with the Ising model and Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ), which we utilized the symmetry of the investigated model. Additionally, I also delved into several optimization methods, both classical and quantum, and analyzed the quantum advantage that each of these methods offered, and then I proposed a new combinatorial optimization scheme that provides a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQE's optimization subroutine.
